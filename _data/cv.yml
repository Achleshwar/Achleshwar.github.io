      institution: Futurewei Technologies Inc. (Huawei R&D), Santa Clara, CA, USA
      year: May - August, 2023
      description:
        - Identified limitations in the existing research on modelling motion using implicit representations such as NeRF and proposed 
          Deblur-NSFF, a method that can perform novel space-time synthesis from videos subject to motion blur or out-of-focus blur
        - Achieved an improvement of 4.3%, and 12.8%, in PSNR and SSIM respectively, and a decrease of 28.12% in LPIPS value
          on modified NVIDIA Dynamic Scenes Dataset, and submitted our work to WACV 2024

      description:
        - Extracted 3D models of pigs from videos using self-supervised learning, neural mesh renderer, and re-projection loss
        - Synthesized a dataset that included segmentation masks to complement re-projection loss-based training algorithm
        - Delivered results on pig tracking and pig 2D pose-estimation, contributing to a CVPRW 2021 ORAL paper on multi-view tracking

      institution: CSIR-CEERI Central Electronics Engineering Research Institute, Pilani, India
      year: October - December, 2020
      description:
        - Explored Inflated 3D ConvNets and Temporal Segment Networks for the task of Fall Detection.
        - Designed a compressive sensing framework to obtain compressed measurements of video sequences as spatio-temporal input.
        - Implemented two reconstruction architectures using densely connected neural networks and Convolutional Neural Network (ReconNet), to retrieve original images from compressed measurements.
