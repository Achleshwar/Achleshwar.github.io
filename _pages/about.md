I am a Masters student in Computer Vision at the [Robotics Institute, CMU](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/). I am also part of [Robots Perceiving and Doing Lab](https://r-pad.github.io/) led by [Prof. David Held](https://davheld.github.io/) and here I closely work with [Ben Eisner](https://beisner.me/) on 3D Scene Understanding.

My research interests are at the interface of 3D Computer Vision and AI, with a focus on `Neural Scene Representations` and `3D Scene Understanding`. I am especially excited about combining deep learning techniques with graphics pipeline for photorealistic rendering of general dynamic scenes. I am also exploring algorithms that can learn to perceive the world around them, and use this understanding to interact with the world.

Previously, I was an undergrad at BITS Pilani where I worked with [Prof. Narendra Ahuja](https://vision.ai.illinois.edu/ahuja.html) on 3D Reconstruction of Animals. Prior to that, I did an internship with [Prof. Jitendra Malik's](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~malik/) group on Single-View 3D Reconstruction of inanimate objects.
