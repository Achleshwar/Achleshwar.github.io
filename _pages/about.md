I am a CS PhD student at Texas A&M University, advised by [Prof. Tomer Galanti](https://tomergalanti.github.io/). My research focuses on the intersection of Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) and Multimodal Learning. I am particularly interested in developing best practices for training SSL models and creating methods that enable these models to learn general-purpose representations and adapt to various modalities.

Previously, I worked at the intersection of 3D Computer Vision and AI, focusing on `Neural Scene Representations` and `3D Scene Understanding`. I earned my Master's degree in Computer Vision from the [Robotics Institute, CMU](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/), where I was advised by [Prof. David Held](https://davheld.github.io/) and [Ben Eisner](https://beisner.me/) on 3D Scene Understanding. During my undergraduate studies at BITS Pilani, I collaborated with [Prof. Narendra Ahuja](https://vision.ai.illinois.edu/ahuja.html) on 3D Reconstruction of Animals and with [Prof. Jitendra Malik's](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~malik/) group on Single-View 3D Reconstruction of inanimate objects.
