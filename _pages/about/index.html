My research focuses on the intersection of Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) and Multimodal Learning. I am particularly interested in developing best practices for training SSL models and creating methods that enable these models to learn general-purpose representations and adapt to various modalities.</p> <p>Previously, I worked at the intersection of 3D Computer Vision and AI, focusing on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Neural Scene Representations</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">3D Scene Understanding</code>. I earned my Master’s degree in Computer Vision from the <a href="https://www.ri.cmu.edu/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Robotics Institute, CMU</a>, where I was advised by <a href="https://davheld.github.io/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Prof. David Held</a> and <a href="https://beisner.me/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Ben Eisner</a> on 3D Scene Understanding.
